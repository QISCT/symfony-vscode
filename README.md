# Symfony for VS Code

This extension aims to help developing Symfony2+ projects, by showing services and routes of your current project.

## Features

This extension add a new view, the *Symfony Debug View*, to visualize the status of your project container and routes. With this, you can :
* know which controller action is binded to a route
* know which class is binded to a service
* see all services aliases
* ...

## How does it works ?

To detect Symfony projects, this extension rely on `composer.json` files with `symfony/symfony` as one of its dependencies.

The `composer.json` file is supposed to be at the root of your Symfony project.

When the project is detected, it simply uses the `debug:container` and `debug:router` console commands to hydrate the views.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `symfony-vscode.phpPath`: the path of the PHP executable.
* `symfony-vscode.consolePath`: when the console is somewhere else than `bin/console` (or `app/console` for Symfony 2), override this setting.
* `symfony-vscode.showAsseticRoutes`: By default, the route view doesn't show routes generated by AsseticBundle. Set this to true if you want to see them.
